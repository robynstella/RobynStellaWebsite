            <h2>Nama-Herero Genocide as a Predecessor to the Holocaust in Uwe Timm’s Morenga:</h2>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Morenga (2005) by Uwe Timm is a German novel which takes place in German Southwest Africa, now Namibia, during the early 1900s. Originally a German novel published in 1983 and then translated to English in 2003 - it follows the oppression and genocide of the Herero and Khoekhoe people (Hottentot is the term used throughout the novel, however, this is a derrogatory slur and will not be used within this essay). The novel is composed of fragmented German military documents and personal experiences from the main character - a veterinarian named Gottschalk. Through this, the novel is able to depict what can now be understood as a predecessor to the Holocaust. This can be clearly seen through various German colonial policies such as the purposeful dehumanization of the colonized, the presence of institutionalized racism, and the use of concentration camps as a means of extermination of the native populations. These policies were then reapplied by the Nazi regimes during the Holocaust. This essay will thus illustrate the extent to which the Namibian genocide can be understood as a predecessor of the Nazi Holocaust.

                1. Defining Characteristics of the Holocaust 
                <br>
                In order to determine the full extent that Nama-Herero genocide can be seen as a predecessor to the later Holocaust, one must first grasp the defining characteristics of the Holocaust. These characteristics can then be traced back in order to determine similarities
                between the genocides. In the late 19th century - the notion of a supreme Aryan race was emerging - this racial concept encapsulated those of a specific heritage. More specifically, a German heritage (Finzsch 3). This racial class is an idea proposed by the early Nazi envisioners. The biggest threat to an Aryan racial superiority was claimed to be the Semite-race. The semite race refers to those of Jewish descent. This categorization of Jewish people as Semites began during the Enlightenment period in Spain (Bergmann 347). While antisemitism was rampant throughout Europe for many years, this reclassification of Jews as Semites - a racial class - created an opportunity for institutionalised oppression as ideas of racial superiority can be placed upon them. This idea was furthered through the false use of Darwinian theory. Hitler believed that racial superiority is achieved through selective breeding - similar to the breeding of cattle for specific superior strains. The Nazi’s central policy was that of protecting the Aryan race from inbreeding with less superior races such as the semites (Bergman 106). Thus, the reclassification of the Jewish ethnoreligious group as the Semite race imbued them with the classification of being less than. These false ideas of racial superiority and the creation of the race provided the basis for the rationale for the extermination of the Jews.

            1.1 Dehumanization and Animalization 
            <br>
            Following this classification, racism became institutionalized and allowed the beginning of the dehumanization. One of the largest driving forces of the Holocaust was the dehumanization of the Jews. Following the racialization of the Jews into Semites, the false ideologies of the Jews as being less led to the dehumanization of the group. Dehumanization can be defined as the active removal or denial of a group or individual's worth as a human (Creedon 317). The stripping of their rights as humans led to Semites being seen as the sub-human -
          
                something not worth the same as the superior Aryan race. In attempts to prevent ‘cross breeding’ between the races, Jewish people were placed into Ghettos. This can be seen as the beginning of the animalization of Jews by the Nazi regime. Ghettos were described as cramped, dirty, and disease-ridden places - these attributes thus were then placed on the Jews themselves. Due to connotations of rodents and vermin being carriers of disease following the plague and the nature of how the species lives, Jews became synonymous with animals and vermin (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum). Racial superiority allowed for the dehumanization and animalization of Jews in the Holocaust. Further, this prejudiced image of Jews as vermin became the main rationale for the extermination of the Jewish people. As they were seen as vermin and rodents that were dangerous to the Aryan race and thus must be exterminated.

                2. The Nama-Herero Genocide
                <br> 
                These characteristics of the Holocaust, however, can only be understood as repetitions of the characteristics of the Nama-Herero genocide within German South-West Africa. Morenga is able to illustrate, clearly, the connections in the treatment of the groups. It demonstrates the similarities between the genocides and is thus useful in depicting the origins of the Holocaust's characteristics. Separate from already existing racism towards black populations, further ideas of racial superiority are heavily present within the novel. The racial classification of Semite is not limited to the ethnoreligious Jew - but rather extends to the native populations of South-West Africa as well. The natives are described as “...something Jewish, which was not surprising, since all the Hottentots were semitic in origin.” (Timm, 146). By classifying the natives as a semite they immediately remove any form of equality between the Germans and the natives that
                may have existed. They are seen as subhuman - something that needs to be kept separate as it is below them due to their ‘savageness’. By characterizing the natives as being below the Germans, anthropological fallacies are created. Through these anthropological fallacies, the natives can be even further oppressed as they do not deserve the same treatment as the superior Germans (Baer 
                68). This use of racial classification is reproduced by the Nazi regimes and thus the Nama-Herero genocide can be understood as a predecessor in this respect. 
                Furthermore, the view of the natives as being below the Germans provides the rationale to capture the natives and keep them separate - this is similar to the separation of Jews into Ghettos. From the early onset of the novel, Gottschalk is confronted with two, what seem to be, animal enclosures or “kraals” (17). One is used to contain animals that are captured from native populations - and the other as a means of containing the natives themselves: 
                “The cattle were a pitiful sight, totally emaciated, many injured by thorns or bullets, with festering wounds. Bodies of dead animals lay scattered everywhere. The stench of carrion filled the air. A large area next to the kraal had been enclosed with barbed wire. Sentries were posted in front with fixed bayonets. Beyond the fence, Gottschalk could see people, or rather skeletons, squatting—no, something halfway between humans and skeletons. They huddled together, mostly naked in the piercingly hot sun.” (Timm, 17) 
                The natives are kept in this enclosure as if they were animals. Gottschalk himself is unaware as to whether or not they are human. This, while not being the first time the natives are seen as animals, resembles the animalization of Jews. The Jews were aimalized into rodents much like how the natives are animalized as cattle. This animalization is further evident in how the natives are determined to be dead. Rather than being checked by doctors, veterinarians are specifically asked.
             
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
              <p>
                 The view of the natives as animals is to such a large extent that they are treated by veterinarians as well: “When the rebel was lying on the ground, Schwanebach ordered the veterinarian to make sure the baboon was dead.” (Timm, 40). The Nama are seen as cattle - something that can be used but simultaneously maintains no importance. This actively demonstrated how racial classification and segregation leads to the animalization of populations (Creedon 320). The dehumanization and animalization of the Nama-Herero populations can thus be clearly understood as a predecessor to the similar dehumanization and animalization of the Jewish population during the Holocaust. 
                This animalization of the Nama-Herero populations is furthered even more. The animalization of the populations provides the rationale for their extermination as if they are animals - and the Germans are human - the Germans maintain their ‘right’ to control, punish, and kill them. This is highlighted by a letter discussing what the most ‘humane’ way of whipping the natives is. The natives are seen as property - something that can be used and controlled like cattle: 
                “I wish . . . to suggest considering whether it might not be deemed appropriate to approach the Colonial Division of the Foreign Office with a suggestion to the effect that the hippo-hide whip be replaced as a means of punishment by a return to our traditional rope. . . . The blows of a hippo-hide whip almost inevitably tear gashes in the skin, and precisely in an area which is hardest for others to see, and particularly difficult to see for the injured man. It is therefore extremely difficult for the man who has been flogged to care for himself. . . . Flogging with a rope is a far different matter. . . . The consequences aren’t nearly so severe, they are milder, more humane and yet of more lasting pedagogical effect.” (Timm, 117)
              
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
              <p>
                This passage highlights the humanistic view held by the Germans (Baer 70). They are discussing the humane way of torturing the animals which preside below them. This view of the natives as animals provides the reasoning for their death, similarly, the classification of Jews as rodents provides the reasoning for killing. Thus, it is evident that various techniques originally used in Namibia were reused in the Holocaust. As such the Nama-Herero Genocide can be easily understood as a predecessor for the Holocaust. Further, Gottschalk originally believes that the starvation of the cattle and natives within the Kraals to be an organizational oversight - rather - it is systematic extermination: 
                “No, . . . they let them starve to death. That’s a subtle but crucial distinction . . . part of a systematic plan. . . . The extermination of the natives. They want the land for settlement.” (Timm, 18) 
                The natives are being exterminated due to the fact that they are seen as animals - similarly to how the Jews were seen as vermin. The same practices used to kill the Nama-Herero populations were re-perpetrated by the Nazis to kill the Jews. The deaths of the natives in South-West Africa were not simply due to oversight - it was a systematic plan in order to achieve more living space and to remove the chance of intermingling. This was repeat dby the Holocaust - the killing and seperation of the Jews removed any chance of intermingling or excess land usage. Thus it is clearly evident that the Nama-Herero genocide can be understood as a predecessor of the Holocaust as the same means of dehumanization, animalization, and extermination are used. 
                The natives are not people - merely pests that can be exterminated. This is a clear predecessor of the extermination of the Jews. They were seen as vermin and thus required extermination. The Nama- Herero genocide can thus be seen as a direct predecessor of the Holocaust - many of the techniques used by the Nazis are German colonial ones. This is furthered even more as soon after this encounter Gottschalk is made aware that it is “[their] concentration camp”. Rather than the administrative oversight he initially thought - this exposes the systematic extermination taking place: of the natives and the cattle. The humans have no worth more than the cattle next to them, they are entirely dehumanized. Further, the sign placed on the fence states “Don't feed the animals.” The dehumanization and animalization of the native people of Namibia can be seen as a direct predecessor of the similar treatment of the Jews. Even further, the first use of concentration camps - a notable characteristic of the Holocaust - by the Germans is in German Southwest Africa. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Therefore, in conclusion, it is clearly evident that Morenga (2005) by Uwe Timm which takes place in German Southwest Africa, now Namibia, during the early 1900s clealy demonstrates the extent to which the genocide can be considered a predecessor to the Holocaust.. Originally a German novel published in 1983 and then translated to English in 2003 the novel provides a distinct postcolonial understanding of what can be described as Germany’s genocidal gaze. Through the following of the oppression and genocide of the Herero and Khoekhoe people Timm is able to detail the specifics which were thenrepurposed by the Nazi regime. The novel is composed of fragmented German military documents and personal experiences from the main character - a veterinarian named Gottschalk. Through this, the novel is able to depict what can now be understood as a predecessor to the Holocaust. Through various German colonial policies such as the purposefull dehumanisation of the colonised, the presence of institutionalised racism, and the use of concentration camps as a means of extermination of the native population it is evident that to a very large extent the Namibian genocide can be understood as a predecessor of the Nazi Holocaust. Through textual analysis this essay has illustrated the extent.

            <h2>Dead Souls as a Novel about how a Novel is written:</h2>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Dead Souls (1842), the poema by Nikolai Gogol. It follows the journey of Chichikov as he travels through provincial Russia collecting serfs. Serf is a Medieval name for labourers who were unpaid and worked for landowners in order to obtain protection and some small land of their own. Landowners had to pay a portion of tax on their serfs. However, this becomes an issue when a census is only completed every 10-15 years. Thus, landowners had to pay taxes on dead serfs (or dead souls). Chichikov thus travels to the landowners in order to buy up the dead souls. This, however, becomes simply a backdrop for a culmination of Gogol’s views on art and his art itself. Gogol had many fictional and non-fictional works before Dead Souls where he details his aesthetic ideal and commentaries on Art. Thus, as it is one of his final works, Dead Souls can be considered a culmination of his Aesthetic ideals and commentaries on Art. This is clearly evident through tracing his earlier work where he defines what he believes art should do and through his authorial digression within the novel. This essay will thus examine the extent that Dead Souls can be understood to be a novel about how a novel is written.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Detailing Gogol’s Literary and Aesthetic Goals.
        <br>
        <p>Dead Souls is one of Gogol’s final pieces of literary works - and this is significant in many ways. Throughout his career, Gogol attempted to create and define the aesthetic foundation for which he intended to write his poema on. His goal was to develop a poema that could demonstrate his vision of a united Russia. Gogol was concerned with incorporating everything of Russian life - the minutiae included - in order to form a single transient image of Russianness. Gogol's aesthetic ideas and definitions of what a poema should be are clearly outlined in his earlier collection of essays called Arabesques (1982). While, within this collection, many cases are given for what he defines as a poema to be. The most useful one can be considered to be Gogol’s commentary on “The last day of Pompeii” - a painting by Brjullov (1833). This piece of art concretely signifies Gogol's aspiration for a complete comprehension of the world, including the minutiae. Gogol describes the painting as “something whole…a complete, universal creation” (Maguire, 107). He is able to fully depict the destruction of Pompeii, from the grand to the minute. Brjullow, thus, is an exemplification of Gogol's artistic goal in his creation of his poema. This aesthetic ideology is furthered even more through Gogol’s own definition of a novel. Within Schoolbook of Literature for Russian Youth, Gogol provides the following definition:
            “A novel, despite being in prose, can be a highly poetic work. A novel is not an epic. It can be called rather a drama. Like a drama, it is an excessively formal work. It also has a strictly and cleverly thought-out plot. All the characters who have to take part or, better, between whom the action should happen, must be chosen beforehand by the author; the author is concerned with the fate of each of them and cannot move them about hurriedly and en masse, like things that go flying by. Each appearance of a character, initially apparently insignificant, heralds his participation later. Everything that happens happens only because it is connected with the fate of the hero himself. Here, as in a drama, an only too close unity between the characters is allowed; any distant relations between them, or encounters of a kind which can be done without, are a vice in a novel and make it long-winded and boring. It flies along like a drama, unified by the vital interest of the characters of the chief plot in which they have been entangled and which in its
            bubbling way makes them evolve and reveal ever more strongly and quickly their personalities, thereby increasing the entertainment. For this reason each character must have a complete role to play. A novel does not cover the whole of life but a notable happening in life, of a kind which has made life reveal itself in a brilliant form, despite the formal spatial limits.” (Freeborn, 20)
            
            It is evident, through this definition, that Gogol’s sole purpose in writing and creation is to provide a full, circular, all encapsulating portrait of not only his characters - but of Russia as well. Gogol’s Realism is intended to be all-encapsulating and that includes the minutiae of life. By reading and understanding Dead Souls through Gogol’s own aesthetic goal it can be understood as a novel about how a novel is written; a means of guiding the reader and placing importance on the purpose of the author in relation to his work.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        2. How Gogol's aesthetic vision comes to fruition.
        <br> 
        <p>Creating a clear thought-out plot and characters of importance becomes difficult when attempting to simultaneously provide a ‘pompeii-like portrait’ of Russia. This is because in order to fully depict the universality of life - one must also depict the negatives. It is stated by Kelly, however, that Gogol provides his own suggestion on how to achieve this ideal. It is stated that Gogol suggests: “an artist can attempt to depict harmony and beauty directly, or he can suggest these ideals by portraying their absence” (Kelly, 26). Kelly terms this means of depiction Ascent through Descent where through displaying a distortion of an idea, one is able to evoke a realization of it. Thus, Gogol’s depictions which are initially read and understood as negatives provide the ability of the opposite to come to fruition within the reader's mind. Within Gogol’s distorted ‘poshlust’ (Nabokov, 531) world, one is able to reach deeper and see an idealized vision. This tension becomes the main means of which Gogol depicts his artistic ideal - and through this is able to write a ‘novel about how a novel is written’.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Gogol’s aesthetic ideal in Dead Souls. 
        <br>
        <p>Within Dead Souls, Gogol’ artist endeavour is said to be most prevalent. Gogol makes use of his characters in order to depict the previously referenced ‘ascent through descent’. Gogol's characters, more specifically the land owners, become the antithesis for his pictured ideal. In doing so, Gogol creates a sense of universality. Nothing in his poema is too specific and his characters lack a sense of individuality. This aids in depicting a whole - one that every person that reads the poema can relate to.  From the early onset of the novel the reader becomes aware of the universality, Chicikov enters a town named simple ‘N’, and the inn he finds is: “of the ordinary sort, and the inn was also of the ordinary sort, that is, precisely like all the inns in provincial towns” (8). This highlights the mundanity of the current world of Russia. However, it too allows Gogol to create a sense of universality, a complete and whole vision of all inns in Russia. Through this, an antithesis can be revealed by the reader - they will notice the gap within Russian society. This universal backdrop becomes the spring-board on which Gogol can depict the banality and poshlust of the surrounding land owners, and in turn, Russia as a whole. The meeting with Manilov is the first encounter with a landowner, however, he is almost faceless and hard to define. This is the same with his estate - little is furnished or taken care of. He lives in a space of liminality. Manilov remains to have no purpose nor drive - he simply exists. This is described by Gogol as “a type of people '' (24) which reflect the formlessness and lack of drive he has noticed within his Russian companions. Korobochka is the next landowner the reader encounters, no comments are made regarding her face. The most distinguishing feature is the scarf around her neck. Similarly, her estate is very neatly packed with each object having a clear place. When asked about surrounding landowners she is completely unaware - nothing exists outside of her material realm. She maintains no metaphysical qualities - through this Gogol hopes his readers will gain some awareness of the banality of material goods. Her facelessness transcends the provincial grounds and rather speaks to aristocracy as a whole and the insensibility innately present. This ascent through descent continues throughout the novel. This fully encapsulates Gogol's aesthetic ideal. There is no connection between his characters except their connection to the main protagonist. Through this, Gogol is able to form a whole vision of Russianness without the formal importance of a plot.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Authorial Digression highlighting Gogol's aesthetic ideals
        <br>
        <p>Gogol partakes in many authorial digressions which do not only highlight his aesthetic ideals but his view on Russianness as a whole. When interacting with Nozdrev the Gogolian narrator makes a comment. It is typically assumed that the outward image somehow displays the internal ideals. Gogol, as discussed earlier, purposefully subverts this idea. Through his antithesis Gogol reveals the true nature of characters, and that their appearances do not display their true inner feelings. This is clearly evident through his digression: 
            "He is everywhere among us and, perhaps, only walks about in a differently styled coat. But people are lightminded and undiscerning, and a person in a differently styled coat seems to them to be a different person" (72)
            Within Gogol's Russia, it is assumed that external facades mimic the interior qualities of individuals, Gogol directly subverts this ideology through his authorial digression. Gogol destroys this illusion and once again creates a universality in his characters. This universality of character is furthered by Sobakevic. He places importance only on material objects, there is no eternal soul. He is completely baseless and mirrors the spiritual void found in all of Russia. An importance is placed on the poshlust, despite the lack of importance it actually provides to his life. The Gogolian narrator once again appears to offer a comment: 
            "It seemed that in this body there was no soul at all, or that it had one, but not at all where it should be, but, as with Koscej the Immortal, was somewhere beyond the mountains and enclosed by such a thick shell that whatever stirred at the bottom produced absolutely no movement on the surface" (101)
            Similarly to Sobakevic, Koscej becomes a characterization of what Gogol deems to be wrong with Russia. He becomes a universal image for Russianness. This directly speaks to Gogol's aesthetic ideology and his definition of a novel - he is achieving his ascent through descent. He is portraying an objective universality while still maintaining his poetic influence and subjectivity. 
            
            Furthermore, separate from Gogol's comments on his own characters, he fuses with this, his own commentary on art and the novel. Gogol discusses ways he wishes his readers to respond to his poema. Directly relating to Gogol's definition of a novel and what an artist should provoke, Gogol makes a comment on how he writes and how the reader should read. The reader should view the world of the novel from “a summit, from which the whole horizon is open to everything that transpires below, whereas only close objects are visible to an individual '' (210). Gogol's means of writing and structuring his novel allow the reader to view an all encapsulating, universal image of the land and the characters. The protagonist can be understood to be the individual he references. Chichikov does not maintain this view of the land and characters, rather, as an individual he is only able to see the close ‘obvious’ objects. Chichikov can be understood as the generalized view of Russian - never looking deeper than what is right in front of them (Timmer, 280). Gogol thus intends to complete his aesthetic ideal by revealing these blinders used. He reveals the universality of his characters and their antithesis as a new proposed way of viewing and living. This is furthered even more in Gogol's comment on Chichikov’s character: 
            “Had the author not delved more deeply into his soul, had he not stirred in its depths that which slips away and hides from the light, had he not revealed those innermost thoughts that a person does not entrust to anyone else, but had shown him as he appeared to the whole town, to Manilov and other people, then everyone would be pleased as punch and would have deemed him an interesting person.” (243)
            According to Google's own definitions of a novel and his own aesthetic ideals, he is not concerned with displaying an epic hero. He is not concerned with structuring an entire novel surrounding a hero who will complete his journey. He is concerned with complete universality and truthfulness in his characters. Thus, Chichikov cannot be what readers expect him to be. He has to subvert expectation in order for the revolutionary ascent through descent to take place. It is this subversion that Gogol hopes will encourage the reader to look inside themselves the same they have his characters. Even further, he directly comments on what he hopes it will achieve: “this weight question will sink into the depths of their own soul: ‘And is there not even in me some part of Chichikov?’” (245). Gogol wants his poema to stir something in his readers, in the Russian public, he wants to stir the introspection that has been absent during the attempted achieval of European ideals. He depicts a universal Russia - one that reflects his readers themselves. Gogol wants to breathe life into the dead souls that read his novels. 
            </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Therefore, in conclusion, one is able to see that Gogol makes use of authorial digressions as a means of depicting his aesthetic ideal and commentaries on what a novel should be. This has been shown through a mapping of his earlier work where he details what he thinks a perfect piece of art should detail (such as the painting by Bryullov); by relating those aesthetic ideals to the novel; and finally by detailing how his authorial digressions reinforce and comment on his aesthetic thoughts and definition of what a novel should be. Thus, Dead Souls can clearly be seen as a novel about how a novel is written.</p>

            <h2>Fragmentation and Multidirectional Memory in Maps:</h2>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>“Postmodernism can be seen, then, as the retheoralization of the proliferation of distinctions that reflect the underlying dynamic of cultural modernity, the need to clear oneself a space.” (Appiah 346) This is an idea proposed by Kwame Anthony Appiah’s essay whereby it is argued that the ‘post’ in Postcolonial and Postmodern are the same. A means of moving away from ‘modernity’ and realism - realism being the search for a singular truth and objective narrative. Maps by Nuruddin Farah encapsulates this idea clearly. Through notably postmodern techniques Farah maps the political and social transformation of a Postcolonial Somalia. The majority of this is done through the use of Fragmentation. Fragmentation is a postmodern literary technique that seeks to subvert a stable narrative, character, or even text as a whole (Mwabu 16). Within the novel this fragmentation is seen through his narrative and plot structure, his characters, and even the physical being of the country. Therefore, Farah’s use of postmodern fragmentation can be seen as an allegory for the crumbling state around him and a means of creating a space for individuals in a postcolonial state through a multidirectional narrative. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Firstly, in order to fully grasp the importance of this Fragmentation, one must understand the nature of the Somali nation at the time of the novel's inception. The setting of Maps is integral as it encapsulates what Farah is displaying through the novel within the physical world.  Somalia pre-colonial powers consisted of six ‘clans’ which moved around as nomadic livestock raisers. The clans interacted yet were not a single stable ‘state’. Therefore, Somaliland can be considered a fragmented nation. Following the entrance of colonial powers the land was split up into five, however, of these five only two were united following the 1960’s (Bryden 24). Following this the nation faced many conflicts and wars, Maps focuses on the Ethiopian and Somalian war over Ogaden in the late seventies. Odagen was given to Ethiopia following Britain's retreat from the area, however Somalia believed it was rightfully theirs. The colonial legacies of territorialization were now visible in the new nation states though their pushing of nationalism. As such the people of Odagen were in constant fear of being displaced and living in fear of attack (Niemi 289). Askar, the protagonist of Maps, is from this fragmented area. Therefore, the fragmentation seen in the structure and narrative of the novel can be seen as an allegory for the state of Somalia. This even further bring the question of boundaries and maps into question, a question which is posed by characters in the novel as well: 

            “...Eduard Kremer, who was the drawer of the
            1567 map, introduced numerous distortions, thereby altering our
            notion of the world and its size did you? Africa, in Kremer’s Map, is
            smaller than Greenland. These Maps which bear in mind the
            European prejudices, are the Maps we used at school when I was
            young and, I am afraid to say, are still being reprinted year after year
            and used in schools in Africa.” (Farah 228)
            
            This alludes to the fragmentation that persists in Africa following the retreat of colonial powers. The borders created are ones created by Colonial powers, not by the people living in the nations, and yet the fight over these borders continues. The Colonial powers are still ever present despite their believed retreat. Farah questions the usefulness of these wars considering the fact that the borders were imposed on them (Cobham 84). The states are already fragmented and yet by fighting over them the wars fragment the people affected by them - such as Askar. 
            </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Fragmentation is evident in the novel through various aspects, firstly the plot of the novel is fragmented. Literary techniques such as allusion, segmentation, non-linearity, etc. are means of which Farah fragments the plot to demonstrate the nature of the Somali nation (Mwabu 26). Fragmentation in the plot and narrative are the forefront for the overall fragmentation of the novel. Farah uses  various techniques throughout in order to depict this. Perhaps most notably is Farah's segmentation of his text. The text is segmented a multitude of times and in a multitude of ways. The novel is initially broken up into three main parts: Part One, Two, and Three, however, these are even further segmented. These parts are segmented into chapters and these chapters into smaller units. This completely disrupts the narrative plot and structure as it is constantly fragmenting and segmenting. This Postmodern technique aids Farah in attempting to portray this fragmented reality of the Somali nation. Even further, between each segment there is an intertextual aid which even further disrupts the fluidity of the plot. Each segment is introduced by another piece of literature which fragments it even more, this is because it demonstrates the nature of creation. The text is written and the reader is constantly made aware of this through the use of other literary quotes - whether it be Conrad or Dickens. Farah makes use of a quote from Conrad to introduce Part Two, however, the quote more adequately speaks to the nature of Farah's novel as a whole: 

            All is illusion—the words written, the mind at which they are aimed,
            the truth they are intended to express, the hand that will hold the
            paper, the eyes that will glance at the lines. Every image floats
            vaguely in a sea of doubt—and the doubt itself is lost in an explored
            universe of uncertitude. (Farah 139)
            
            This quote describes to the reader what Farah’s intent is. He is purposefully fragmenting the novel in order to allude to the nature of the Somali nation as a whole. Nothing is supposed to make clear sense because there is no certainty for the nation. This directly disrupts the reader's view that there is an objective choice and points to Farah's writing. There is no single narrative or voice present, but rather a fragmentation of multiple. Even further, the introduction to specific segments by other literary pieces intrinsically forces the reader to almost compare the texts. Therefore through this fragmentation not only is the physical text fragmented (which alludes to the actual writteness and production on the text) but the meaning of the sections is also fragmented. From the outset the novel is physically fragmented which lends to the reader this understanding before even beginning.
            </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Separate from the structure, there is a sense of fragmentation through the narrative itself. Farah is constantly switching pronouns and times which furthers the confusion and fragmentation of the narrative (Sugnet 739). Through various disembodied narratives allude to the creation of characters through multiple narratives. This can be seen where the reader is unaware of who is speaking: 

            ‘A voice…telling a story: A man. A woman. A dog.’ (Farah 187)
            
            Even further, the fragmented nature of the novel is shown through Farah’s use of journal entries and letters throughout the novel. These are used within the narrative as if they are not letters or written works. The reader must deduce what they are and who they are from thus further fragmenting the narrative and the nature of the Somali nation. One that is created by competing voices, ideologies, and people. This narrative complexity is undeniably Postmodern as it requires the reader to almost piece together what is happening. A piecing together which mirrors the attempted piecing of the characters.
            </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The fragmentation of characters in Maps can be seen as an allegory for the nature of Somaliness following and during the war. Farah challenges the idea of the Somalian people being a homogenous group and nation through the fragmentation of characters throughout Maps (Wright 195). Askar was born in Ogaden and adopted by an Ethiopian woman named Misra until he later moved to Mogadisico with his aunt and uncle. This change of living place means that he has many competing perspectives throughout his life. These competing ideologies are the initial depiction of Askars fragmentation, this is because he has Somaliness from his parents, Ethiopianness from his adoptive mother Misra, and a metropolitan-ness from living in Mogadiscio. Even further, Askars birth can, perhaps, be seen as an allegory for the attempted birth of the Somali nation (Mwabu). This is because he was worn with blood marks around his neck, almost as if he had been born from a struggle or even tried to be killed by his mother: 
        
            “And around your neck were finger-stains, perhaps 
            your mothers.” (Nobody knows to this day whether 
            she tried to kill you or no).” (Farah 4) 
            
            It is suggested by Samuel Mwabu that this could be considered an allegory for the attempted birth of the Somali nation following the struggles and violence caused by colonial powers. Even further, Askar can be considered an allegory for the Ogaden region, the people of this region constantly being displaced by colonial powers and regimes. Ogaden was handed over to Ethiopia by British Colonial powers and this led to constant war over the territory. Constantly being displaced between Ethiopia and Somalia - much like Askar. In this sense, Misra can be seen as an allegory for Ethiopia. Askars circumcision can then be seen as the removal of Ogaden from Ethiopia: 
            
            What mattered, … [was] that he was totally detached from his 
            mother figure Misra, and weaned. In the process of looking for 
            a substitute, he had found another –Somalia his mother country. (Farah 100)
            
            This physical fragmentation of Askar through his circumcision is an allegory of the fragmentation of Somalia through the violence caused over the territory of Ogaden. Similarly to how Somalia attempts to sever the ties it once held with Ethiopia, Askar does the same with Misra. This even further fragments Askars sense of self. 
            
            Askars fragmented sense of self is highlighted by Farah through the scene whereby he looks at himself in the mirror. Askar begins to change the pronoun he identifies himself with which textually highlights this fragmentation: 
            
            “You had the feeling, however that your face fitted you
            extraordinarily and the identity of your newer self? It was like 
            a dot in the distance which assumed features you could identify 
            now becoming a man, now a woman—or even the animal,” (Farah 63).
            
            This fragmentation in Askar is a direct result of his constant displacement and questioning of origin, much like the attempted unified Somaliness following and during the war. This questioning of gender is furthered even more through Askars supposed menstruation and the woman living inside of him. Askrs entire character is fragmented and made up of a multiplicity of characters (Cobham 84-85). This is representative of the nature of Somaliness, there is no homogenous Somalia and thus no single sense of Somaliness. There is a constant argument between Askers inner selves, much like the discourse of Somaliness: 
            
            “For a long time, yourselves argued with one another. 
            Each offering counter arguments...” (Farah 58)
            
            However, what perhaps shows the most fragmentation in Askar is when he is issued his Somali papers. This is because by doing so his entire history is erased - his birth, his adoptive mother, and his move (Niemi). Askar moves from being a refugee to a citizen - a transition he is not fully equipped for. This segmented view of Askars life fragments his identity even more. This is allegorized through the physical fragmentation of his photo, Askar questions whether a face is adequate enough to show the entire being: 
            
            “Are we merely faces? I mean are faces the keys 
            to our identity?...” (Farah 172) 
            
            Askar is unable to grasp an identity that erases Misra, the receiving of his papers removes the fragmented nature of his life. His issue with this is perhaps an allegory for the nature of Somaliness - there is no single form of Somaliness and rather it is fragmented itself. Farah, however, is not suggesting that this fragmented nature is a bad thing, but rather something that should be celebrated and accepted. The nationalist regime however attempts to erase this much like Askars papers do. 
            </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Furthermore, this fragmented nature of Askars identity can be read as a form of multidirectional memory. Multidirectional memory refers to the idea proposed by Rothberg within his seminal essay. Rothberg identifies a fault to the existing trauma theories currently in use. This fault is that there is a suggestion that there is a way of analyzing trauma which is universal and which, while unintentionally, ignores historical contexts of trauma. Rothberg, rather, suggests that the ways in which we analyze trauma must be ever evolving and transforming in order to meet the needs of the post-colonial world. This is because individual and communal traumas happen concurrently and are often connected in ways which have not been previously analyzed (Rothberg 4). This is largely evident in Maps and is shown directly through Farah’s use of allegory and fragmentation. Minna states that Maps produces what can be called a productful space of multidirectional - this thus suggests that Farah's use of postmodernism aid is depicting the usefulness of multidirectional memory in understanding trauma and identity. Rather than suggesting one true representation of History, Askar represents the competing and clashing histories that exist within a postcolonial society - a fragmented one (Emmett 19). The nations of Somalia and Ethiopia suffer the traumas and histories of colonial powers and their colonizing and territorialization of their land, however, they also once again perpetuate these atrocities once again in the region of Ogaden: 

            “‘Somalis come Ethiopians’ go, every twenty, fifty, or a hundred 
            years or so. Waves of atmospheric spirits fill the air of any place 
            where the dead are not buried.” (Farah 122) 
            
            The dislocations which took place in the Ogaden region historically remove any sense of meaningful singular memory in its history because it is made up of multiple narratives and traumas. Much like Askar, the memories and creations of Odagen are fragmented and constituted from many competing narratives. Thus the use of Multidirectional memory aids in understanding the traumas of Odagen and Askar. Askars fragmentation is not due to a single unspeakable trauma but a constant struggle between powers and narratives through his life. Even further, Askar himself takes on the position of the implicated subject. The implicated subject refers to the notion that a subject is “– neither simply perpetrator nor victim, though potentially either or both at other moments” (Rothberg 2014). Askar is neither simply the victim or perpetrator within his narrative but consists of both simultaneously and at different times. Whether it be his complicity in Misras death or his position as a refugee displaced from his home (Emmett 19). His position as an implicated subject is perhaps most visible from the receiving of his identification papers. He directly moves from victim to privileged when he is granted citizenship.  Thus it is evident that Multidirectional memory is useful and used in Farah's writing of Askar and the notion on Somaliness as a whole.
            </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Therefore, in conclusion, it is evident that Farah is using Postmodernism in order to create a space for his characters and people in a postcolonial world as a whole. This is done as a means of moving away from ‘modernity’ and the realist and Western idea of a a singular truth and objective narrative. Through notably postmodern techniques Farah maps the political and social transformation of a Postcolonial Somalia. The majority of this is done through the use of Fragmentation. Fragmentation is a postmodern literary technique that seeks to subvert a stable narrative, character, or even text as a whole. Within the novel this fragmentation is seen through Farah's structure, narrative, and characters themselves. Farah makes use of these techniques in order to propose a new idea of Somaliness - the nature of existence in a postcolonial state is a multidirectional one and he shows this through fragmentation. He creates a space by eliminating the limiting and opening up for the liminal and the fragmented. Farah is successful in his attempt as one is able to grasp the nature of Askars existence and his struggle with identity and even further he is able to propose a new idea of Somaliness. One that was not previously available due to Nationalist and Colonial powers. </p>

                <h2>“I brought you into this universe and exposed your awareness to all its varieties without any defences.”: An Ecofeminist Analysis of Dune as a paradigm for uncovering the connections between Social and Environmental domination.</h2>
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>It is stated by Murray Bookchin that the domination of nature by humans and that of humans by humans is inextricably connected - even the very concepts of it (Bookchin 62). This is the relationship that Ecofeminism seeks to explore - more than the reduction by the name - ecofeminism is not concerned with simply Ecology and Feminism. Rather, the theory approaches ideas of Anthropocentrism, Environmental degradation, and Social injustices as connected structures. Even further, rather than simply analysing connected structures, Ecofeminism “can be seen as a paradigm for the tracing of interrelations between different formations of domination based on difference.” (Cudworth 101). Dune (Herbert) provides many criticisms of natural degradation through his treatment of water and Arrakis as a whole - however - when analysing this through an ecofeminist framework these ecocriticisms may allude to a deeper social criticism. This is especially useful when viewing the roles of women, Religion, and Culture within the novel. A focus on The Fremen, The Harkonnens, Paul, and more will be used to analyse the social injustices. Therefore, my research will subject Dune to an ecofeminist reading in order to uncover the allusions to other forms of dominations and how these can be read as criticisms of the state of society separate from the novel.</p>
