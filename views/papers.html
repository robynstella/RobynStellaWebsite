            Nama-Herero Genocide as a Predecessor to the Holocaust in Uwe Timm’s Morenga: 
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Morenga (2005) by Uwe Timm is a German novel which takes place in German Southwest Africa, now Namibia, during the early 1900s. Originally a German novel published in 1983 and then translated to English in 2003 - it follows the oppression and genocide of the Herero and Khoekhoe people (Hottentot is the term used throughout the novel, however, this is a derrogatory slur and will not be used within this essay). The novel is composed of fragmented German military documents and personal experiences from the main character - a veterinarian named Gottschalk. Through this, the novel is able to depict what can now be understood as a predecessor to the Holocaust. This can be clearly seen through various German colonial policies such as the purposeful dehumanization of the colonized, the presence of institutionalized racism, and the use of concentration camps as a means of extermination of the native populations. These policies were then reapplied by the Nazi regimes during the Holocaust. This essay will thus illustrate the extent to which the Namibian genocide can be understood as a predecessor of the Nazi Holocaust.

                1. Defining Characteristics of the Holocaust 
                In order to determine the full extent that Nama-Herero genocide can be seen as a predecessor to the later Holocaust, one must first grasp the defining characteristics of the Holocaust. These characteristics can then be traced back in order to determine similarities
                between the genocides. In the late 19th century - the notion of a supreme Aryan race was emerging - this racial concept encapsulated those of a specific heritage. More specifically, a German heritage (Finzsch 3). This racial class is an idea proposed by the early Nazi envisioners. The biggest threat to an Aryan racial superiority was claimed to be the Semite-race. The semite race refers to those of Jewish descent. This categorization of Jewish people as Semites began during the Enlightenment period in Spain (Bergmann 347). While antisemitism was rampant throughout Europe for many years, this reclassification of Jews as Semites - a racial class - created an opportunity for institutionalised oppression as ideas of racial superiority can be placed upon them. This idea was furthered through the false use of Darwinian theory. Hitler believed that racial superiority is achieved through selective breeding - similar to the breeding of cattle for specific superior strains. The Nazi’s central policy was that of protecting the Aryan race from inbreeding with less superior races such as the semites (Bergman 106). Thus, the reclassification of the Jewish ethnoreligious group as the Semite race imbued them with the classification of being less than. These false ideas of racial superiority and the creation of the race provided the basis for the rationale for the extermination of the Jews.

            1.1 Dehumanization and Animalization 
            Following this classification, racism became institutionalized and allowed the beginning of the dehumanization. One of the largest driving forces of the Holocaust was the dehumanization of the Jews. Following the racialization of the Jews into Semites, the false ideologies of the Jews as being less led to the dehumanization of the group. Dehumanization can be defined as the active removal or denial of a group or individual's worth as a human (Creedon 317). The stripping of their rights as humans led to Semites being seen as the sub-human -
          
                something not worth the same as the superior Aryan race. In attempts to prevent ‘cross breeding’ between the races, Jewish people were placed into Ghettos. This can be seen as the beginning of the animalization of Jews by the Nazi regime. Ghettos were described as cramped, dirty, and disease-ridden places - these attributes thus were then placed on the Jews themselves. Due to connotations of rodents and vermin being carriers of disease following the plague and the nature of how the species lives, Jews became synonymous with animals and vermin (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum). Racial superiority allowed for the dehumanization and animalization of Jews in the Holocaust. Further, this prejudiced image of Jews as vermin became the main rationale for the extermination of the Jewish people. As they were seen as vermin and rodents that were dangerous to the Aryan race and thus must be exterminated.

                2. The Nama-Herero Genocide 
                These characteristics of the Holocaust, however, can only be understood as repetitions of the characteristics of the Nama-Herero genocide within German South-West Africa. Morenga is able to illustrate, clearly, the connections in the treatment of the groups. It demonstrates the similarities between the genocides and is thus useful in depicting the origins of the Holocaust's characteristics. Separate from already existing racism towards black populations, further ideas of racial superiority are heavily present within the novel. The racial classification of Semite is not limited to the ethnoreligious Jew - but rather extends to the native populations of South-West Africa as well. The natives are described as “...something Jewish, which was not surprising, since all the Hottentots were semitic in origin.” (Timm, 146). By classifying the natives as a semite they immediately remove any form of equality between the Germans and the natives that
                may have existed. They are seen as subhuman - something that needs to be kept separate as it is below them due to their ‘savageness’. By characterizing the natives as being below the Germans, anthropological fallacies are created. Through these anthropological fallacies, the natives can be even further oppressed as they do not deserve the same treatment as the superior Germans (Baer 
                68). This use of racial classification is reproduced by the Nazi regimes and thus the Nama-Herero genocide can be understood as a predecessor in this respect. 
                Furthermore, the view of the natives as being below the Germans provides the rationale to capture the natives and keep them separate - this is similar to the separation of Jews into Ghettos. From the early onset of the novel, Gottschalk is confronted with two, what seem to be, animal enclosures or “kraals” (17). One is used to contain animals that are captured from native populations - and the other as a means of containing the natives themselves: 
                “The cattle were a pitiful sight, totally emaciated, many injured by thorns or bullets, with festering wounds. Bodies of dead animals lay scattered everywhere. The stench of carrion filled the air. A large area next to the kraal had been enclosed with barbed wire. Sentries were posted in front with fixed bayonets. Beyond the fence, Gottschalk could see people, or rather skeletons, squatting—no, something halfway between humans and skeletons. They huddled together, mostly naked in the piercingly hot sun.” (Timm, 17) 
                The natives are kept in this enclosure as if they were animals. Gottschalk himself is unaware as to whether or not they are human. This, while not being the first time the natives are seen as animals, resembles the animalization of Jews. The Jews were aimalized into rodents much like how the natives are animalized as cattle. This animalization is further evident in how the natives are determined to be dead. Rather than being checked by doctors, veterinarians are specifically asked.

            <br>
            <br>
              <p>
                 The view of the natives as animals is to such a large extent that they are treated by veterinarians as well: “When the rebel was lying on the ground, Schwanebach ordered the veterinarian to make sure the baboon was dead.” (Timm, 40). The Nama are seen as cattle - something that can be used but simultaneously maintains no importance. This actively demonstrated how racial classification and segregation leads to the animalization of populations (Creedon 320). The dehumanization and animalization of the Nama-Herero populations can thus be clearly understood as a predecessor to the similar dehumanization and animalization of the Jewish population during the Holocaust. 
                This animalization of the Nama-Herero populations is furthered even more. The animalization of the populations provides the rationale for their extermination as if they are animals - and the Germans are human - the Germans maintain their ‘right’ to control, punish, and kill them. This is highlighted by a letter discussing what the most ‘humane’ way of whipping the natives is. The natives are seen as property - something that can be used and controlled like cattle: 
                “I wish . . . to suggest considering whether it might not be deemed appropriate to approach the Colonial Division of the Foreign Office with a suggestion to the effect that the hippo-hide whip be replaced as a means of punishment by a return to our traditional rope. . . . The blows of a hippo-hide whip almost inevitably tear gashes in the skin, and precisely in an area which is hardest for others to see, and particularly difficult to see for the injured man. It is therefore extremely difficult for the man who has been flogged to care for himself. . . . Flogging with a rope is a far different matter. . . . The consequences aren’t nearly so severe, they are milder, more humane and yet of more lasting pedagogical effect.” (Timm, 117)

              <p>
                This passage highlights the humanistic view held by the Germans (Baer 70). They are discussing the humane way of torturing the animals which preside below them. This view of the natives as animals provides the reasoning for their death, similarly, the classification of Jews as rodents provides the reasoning for killing. Thus, it is evident that various techniques originally used in Namibia were reused in the Holocaust. As such the Nama-Herero Genocide can be easily understood as a predecessor for the Holocaust. Further, Gottschalk originally believes that the starvation of the cattle and natives within the Kraals to be an organizational oversight - rather - it is systematic extermination: 
                “No, . . . they let them starve to death. That’s a subtle but crucial distinction . . . part of a systematic plan. . . . The extermination of the natives. They want the land for settlement.” (Timm, 18) 
                The natives are being exterminated due to the fact that they are seen as animals - similarly to how the Jews were seen as vermin. The same practices used to kill the Nama-Herero populations were re-perpetrated by the Nazis to kill the Jews. The deaths of the natives in South-West Africa were not simply due to oversight - it was a systematic plan in order to achieve more living space and to remove the chance of intermingling. This was repeat dby the Holocaust - the killing and seperation of the Jews removed any chance of intermingling or excess land usage. Thus it is clearly evident that the Nama-Herero genocide can be understood as a predecessor of the Holocaust as the same means of dehumanization, animalization, and extermination are used. 
                The natives are not people - merely pests that can be exterminated. This is a clear predecessor of the extermination of the Jews. They were seen as vermin and thus required extermination. The Nama- Herero genocide can thus be seen as a direct predecessor of the

                Holocaust - many of the techniques used by the Nazis are German colonial ones. This is furthered even more as soon after this encounter Gottschalk is made aware that it is “[their] concentration camp”. Rather than the administrative oversight he initially thought - this exposes the systematic extermination taking place: of the natives and the cattle. The humans have no worth more than the cattle next to them, they are entirely dehumanized. Further, the sign placed on the fence states “Don't feed the animals.” The dehumanization and animalization of the native people of Namibia can be seen as a direct predecessor of the similar treatment of the Jews. Even further, the first use of concentration camps - a notable characteristic of the Holocaust - by the Germans is in German Southwest Africa. 
                Therefore, in conclusion, it is clearly evident that Morenga (2005) by Uwe Timm which takes place in German Southwest Africa, now Namibia, during the early 1900s clealy demonstrates the extent to which the genocide can be considered a predecessor to the Holocaust.. Originally a German novel published in 1983 and then translated to English in 2003 the novel provides a distinct postcolonial understanding of what can be described as Germany’s genocidal gaze. Through the following of the oppression and genocide of the Herero and Khoekhoe people Timm is able to detail the specifics which were thenrepurposed by the Nazi regime. The novel is composed of fragmented German military documents and personal experiences from the main character - a veterinarian named Gottschalk. Through this, the novel is able to depict what can now be understood as a predecessor to the Holocaust. Through various German colonial policies such as the purposefull dehumanisation of the colonised, the presence of institutionalised racism, and the use of concentration camps as a means of extermination of the native population it is

                evident that to a very large extent the Namibian genocide can be understood as a predecessor of the Nazi Holocaust. Through textual analysis this essay has illustrated the extent.
