        <p>Iâ€™m a final year Honour student at the University of Witwatersrand, majoring in English Literature and Language. Ever since I can remember I have been a highly creative individual with a specific knack for the English language. As such, a convergence between my love for English and Creativity resulted in a deep-rooted interest in PR and Digital Marketing. With excellent written and verbal communication as well as impeccable interpersonal skills, I believe I would be a valuable addition to any team. What I may lack in experience I make up for in sheer drive and determination - I am always willing to learn and put in the hard graft in order to complete a task.
